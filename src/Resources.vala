/**
 * Resources
 * 
 * Idea is to manage resourse used by the app.
 * 
 * The original code downloaded all the resources before it renders the main window
 * 
 * This is a bit annoying as although they do change quite a bit, it's not on every page load
 * 
 * So the Resource fetching behaviour should be a button on the File view page
 * That starts the refresh of the resources.
 * 
 * I'm not quite sure how we should flow this - if we do them all at once.. might be a bit of a server 
 * overload... so sequentially may be best...
