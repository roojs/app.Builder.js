App Builder

This is a Seed based application builder.. - currently basically a prototype..


The idea is that it can build applications both web based (using roojs) and Desktop based using Gtk
and the gobject introspection bindings.

It's kind of like Glade on steroids..

-----------------------------------------------------
Where it is..

* basic builder app runs - you can build a tree of elements making up a interface for roo and gtk.


-----------------------------------------------------
TODO
* listeners need to created correctly.

* templates for elements... - eg. defaults for classic elements.
* sort out add heirachy for Gtk..
* make heirachy editor...
* use application to write itself...
