These fixes may need adding to the various .gir's 

Then compile the with g-ir-compile /usr/share/gir-1.0/XXXX.gir -o /usr/lib/girepository-1.0/XXXX.typelib



gtk_tree_view_get_dest_row_at_pos
 - path & pos both need direction="out"
 
 
 --------------------------

 gtk_tree_view_get_selection
 
 ??? return value is currently tranfer-ownership = full??
